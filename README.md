CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION IN THE TELECOMMUNICATION SECTOR

1. About The Project

In the competitive telecommunications sector, this academic project focuses on predicting customer churn to support companies in enhancing retention strategies and improving overall performance. The goal of this research is to identify and analyze the critical factors that influence customer retention in this specific industry and to develop a predictive model that can anticipate customer churn using historical and behavioral data.

2. Built With

Data analysis and model creation have been performed using RStudio.

3. Hypothesis

The research questions stated for this project have led to the following hypotheses:

- H0: There is no significant relationship between the dependent variable *churn* and the independent variables: customer satisfaction score, tenure, monthly charges, unlimited data usage, and customer demographic characteristics (age, senior status, etc.).
- H1: There is a significant relationship between the dependent variable *churn* and the independent variables: customer satisfaction score, tenure, monthly charges, unlimited data usage, and customer demographic characteristics (age, senior status, etc.).

4. Prerequisites

- The dataset was collected from Hugging Face.com (secondary internal-type dataset).
- R and RStudio must be installed to run the analysis.

5. Methods

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to identify trends, outliers, and potential data issues.
- Correlation analysis assessed the strength and direction of relationships between the predictor variables and churn.
- The dataset was transformed and partitioned.
- A Logistic Regression Model was created, tested, and conclusions were drawn.

6. Expectations

Due to time constraints, this model was not compared with other models. Future research could expand on this analysis by selecting and comparing the best model to better meet the studyâ€™s needs.
